# AA2UA (All-Atom to United Atom)

AA2UA is an open-source software package designed to convert
all-atom [Protein Data Bank (PDB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank_(file_format)) molecular models into
their Coarse-Grained (CG) United Atom (UA) counterparts presented in the
journal article entitled [Introducing a force-matched united atom force field to explore larger spatiotemporal domains
in molecular dynamics simulations of bitumen](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2024.112831)

Using [Python 3.12](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.12.html) and [Rdkit](https://www.rdkit.org/), the software
automatically reads .PDB files containing all-atom information of a molecular
system, extracts each molecule, determines higher order bonding information, assigns force field atom types and
masses, and generates a [LAMMPS structure file](https://docs.lammps.org/2001/data_format.html) with all the topologies
and force field definitions required
to run a LAMMPS simulations using the developed UA force field. AA2UA ensures a seamless conversion process,
making it easier for researchers to explore material properties without the extensive manual effort typically required
for such conversions.

## Quick start

Upon successfully installing [Numpy](https://numpy.org/),
[Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) and [Rdkit](https://www.rdkit.org/), you are ready to run
AA2UA. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. **Run the Command**: Execute the following command in your terminal
   or command prompt:
   ``` bash
   python aa2ua.py
   ```

   By default, there are five .pdb files included in the `input/`
   directory: `ethylbenzene.pdb`, `phenol.pdb`, `pyrrole.pdb`, `thiophene.pdb`, and
   `mixture.pdb`. These files correspond to all-atom mixtures of different organic molecules of various complexities.
   Upon
   executing `python aa2ua.py`, all five files will be converted into their UA counterparts.

2. **Locating & Visualizing the Output**:
   The results are exported into the `/outputs` directory, with each structure.data file named after its corresponding
   input file. The resulting files can be easily visualized using [OVITO](https://www.ovito.org/). The ethylbenzene
   model,
   in its UA form, should look like this:
   ![resources/images/ethylbenzene.PNG](resources/images/ethylbenzene.PNG)

3. **Loading into LAMMPS**:
   Use the LAMMPS' [read_data](https://docs.lammps.org/read_data.html) command in an input script to import the
   structure.data file generated by AA2UA.

## What kind of atomistic systems can be converted?

This can be answered by analysing the type of systems compatible with the UA-CG force field developed by our team. As of
now, only amorphous hydrocarbon systems are compatible, especially those whose composition is based on molecules used in
the oil, gas, and asphalt industries. To get an idea of the variety of molecules that can be converted, refer to Table 2
in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2024.112831.
